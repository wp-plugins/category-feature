The Featured Category Widget is basically a Featured Post Widget for a category.

== Description ==

The Featured Category Widget is mainly designed because there were people for whom the Featured Post Widget was not enough. They wanted to put a category of their blog in the highlight.
If there is a post thumbnail, it will be displayed above the headline of the post. If there is no thumbnail, the first picture of the post is taken. You can set the size for the thumbnail or just take the standard from your options. Decide yourself, whether you want to show the excerpt, saved with your post or just the first three sentences or the first twenty words of the post. Style the widget individually, ready.

The Featured Category was tested up to WP 3.9. It should work with versions down to 2.9 but was never tested on those.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `category-feature` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place and customize your widgets
4. Ready

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I styled the widget container myself and it looks bad. What do I do? =

The styling of the widget requires some knowledge of css. If you are not familiar with that, try adding

`padding: 10px;
margin-bottom: 10px;`
 
to the style section.

= My widget should have rounded corners, how do I do that? =

Add something like

`-webkit-border-top-left-radius: 5px;
-webkit-border-top-right-radius: 5px;
-moz-border-radius-topleft: 5px;
-moz-border-radius-topright: 5px;
border-top-left-radius: 5px;
border-top-right-radius: 5px;`
 
to the widget style. This is not supported by all browsers yet, but should work in almost all of them.

= My widget should have a shadow, how do I do that? =

Add something like

`-moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
-webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;`
 
to the widget style to get a nice shadow down right of the container. This is not supported by all browsers yet, but should work in almost all of them.
